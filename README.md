# Damn Vulnerable FPS (DVFPS)

## Project Description

This project is a deliberately vulnerable First-Person Shooter (FPS) game developed using the Godot Engine and a custom C++ network stack. The primary purpose of this project is to teach game security concepts by exposing common vulnerabilities and demonstrating how they can be exploited and mitigated.

## Features

- **Custom C++ Network Stack**: The game uses a custom-built network stack to handle multiplayer interactions.
- **Deliberate Vulnerabilities**: Includes common security flaws such as SQL injection, buffer overflow, and insecure authentication, flawed sever authority, and more.
- **Educational Focus**: Designed to help developers understand and learn how to secure game applications.
- **Godot Engine**: Utilizes the Godot Engine for game development, providing a robust and flexible platform for creating 2D and 3D games.
